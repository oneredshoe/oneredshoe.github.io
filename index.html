                                <li> Designed and formatted the intro sequence to the game in order to introduce the characters and the emotions that the love that will fuel the player’s gameplay through the levels. This included focusing on interpersonal relations between all kinds of family members and a baby, and how to glimpse the baby’s full range of emotions in a limited amount of time.</li>
                                <li> Designed the main player character, including her appearance and main aspects of her personality beyond “Main Character in a VR game”, fleshed out some of her background and tried to implement it into her overall design.</li>
                                <li> Researched methods of 2D facial animation on 3D characters, and investigated ways to further make emotions and presentation adaptable and easy to implement. </li>
                                <li> Created research-related documentation that could then be implemented in Unreal Blueprints and edited as the technology reacted positively/negatively. </li>
                                <li> Created unique sprite sheets per each character (6 total) for face animations, with at least 2 animations each to match the characters both ingame and in the intro cutscene. Each character had also been assigned a personal art style, and those styles are reflected in the characters’ eyes for a personal touch.</li>
                                <li> Now 3 years and multiple different teams later, my face animations and the research implemented in making them emote on command are still in the game!</li>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0"> I have always had a consistent interest in history and law topics, stemming from watching criminal justice shows as a kid and engaging in history classes growing up. This is why half of my undergrad courses were history or law themed. From unsolved true crime stories to historical fiction with accurate elements, it's all fascinating to me.</p>
                    <p><br> When interacting with games, I'm an explorer: I will search high and low for new games to check out. I love playing new indie games and old alike; there's nothing better than experiencing someone's passion through their game, many of which don't end up on the front page of the big corporation stores. I also dabble in art of my own, trying to express my own passion visually to support my game design concepts.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0"> More than anything else, however, I am an instinctive visual student. I learn outside of class by witnessing others' talents and tricks to their trades. Observing others helps me grow as a person and so I love wandering art fairs and watching videos of artists doing their crafts.
                        <br><br>My dream is to one day work on a game that can comfortably be played during a stay at a hospital: Low time pressure, comforting, and engaging enough to distract the player from reality for a little bit

                                    <p class="mb-5">Changeling is a supernatural VR game that deals with the heavy topics of losing a child early on in their life.</p>
                                    <p>This project is connected to my work experience below as the Concept Intern at Xana Ad Hoc.</p>
                                    <p>I created the overall concepts for Aurelia, the main character and detective that investigates the happenings within her community. Her current design has been altered from my original plan, but the red curly hair persists.</p>
                                    <p>I also directed the original intro cutscene for the game, which introduces the player to the overall exposition of the game, as well as setting up the creepy conflict that happened in the apartment.</p>
                                    <p> Under the tech art title, I also researched and helped created a system that allowed our developers to plug and play 2D facial animations on the characters within the game. This concept seems to be still in use by the current team on the project, as it helps reduce the workload on the modelers, riggers, and animators of the project.</p>
                                    <p>My overall roles were <u>Storyboard Artist</u>, <u>Concept Artist</u>, and <u>Technical Animator</u>.</p>
